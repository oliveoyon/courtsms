you know i am a laravel developer, i ma working with an application named courtsms, with laravel12, breeze, spatie. i have completed the permission related things. i have also created the Divisions, Distritcs and Courts and users. Our idea is to send SMS/Whatsapp or both to the witnesses. Court staff will send the sms with minimal input as his users is belongs to division, district and court. He will enter the witness name, phone number multiple (add row with name and phone), scheduled date and time. please note that others necessary parameter will be on database. per can multiple messages can be send like 10 days before, 3 days before and dynamic. however, each case can have multiple witness as i said earlier. we will track how many of them appeared before court in selected date. will generate comprehensive reports. will be integrated with SMS API, Whatsapp api etc. give me precise but powerful comprehensive ideas, how we can go together with you Mr. GPT
