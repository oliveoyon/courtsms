## ðŸŽ¯ **User-Based Report Access**

## ðŸ“Š **Example Report Visualizations**

1. **Dashboard KPIs:**

   * % Notifications Delivered
   * Attendance Rate

2. **Bar/Line Charts:**

   * Cases trend over time (per month).
   * Notifications sent vs delivered trend.
   * Witness attendance % by court.

3. **Tabular Reports (exportable CSV/PDF):**

   * List of cases with witness attendance and notification history.

ðŸ‘‰ So in short:

* **Case-centric reports** (whatâ€™s happening legally).
* **Witness-centric reports** (who came, who was notified).
* **Notification-centric reports** (communication effectiveness).
* **Template/schedule usage reports** (system optimization).
* **Performance reports** (accountability by district/court/staff).

Would you like me to **design a sample reporting dashboard layout** (like which cards, which charts, which tables to put) for ministry vs district vs court? That way you can directly plan UI/UX.
